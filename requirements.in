# Used for modeling AI parameters.
# NOTE: stable-baselines wants gym[atari,classic_control] but we
# can't satisfy the "atari" extra because it requires ale-py
# which has no source distributions or RasPi wheels.
# Using pip's new backtracking resolver from pip>=20.3 is required
# as it improves handling of extras required by indirect dependencies.
# NOTE: gym v0.22 modified the gym.Env API.
